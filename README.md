### Static To-Do list made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Simple web-based to-do list made with html, css and js.
Through JS's onchange event, every change is automatically persisted locally and the list's completion leads to a change in the page's background color.
Data is persisted locally through Local Storage (HTML Web Storage API).
