### Static To-Do list made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Simple web-based to-do list made with js, html and css hosted at GitHub Pages (https://69-richard-dias-ribeiro.github.io).
Through JS's onchange event, every change is automatically persisted locally and the list's completion leads to a change in the page's background color.
Data is persisted locally through Local Storage (HTML Web Storage API).
