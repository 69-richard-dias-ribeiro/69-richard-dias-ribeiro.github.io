### Example of a To-Do list made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Static to-do list made with js, html and css hosted with GitHub Pages (https://69-richard-dias-ribeiro.github.io).

Through JavaScript's onchange event, every change in terms of finished/unfinished tasks is automatically persisted locally and the list's completion leads to a change in the page's background color for a clearer visual feedback.

Data is persisted locally through Local Storage (HTML Web Storage API).
